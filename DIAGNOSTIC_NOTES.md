# Quick Diagnostic Steps

## What I found in the logs:
- Backend is returning `404 Not Found` for `/api/v1/assets/` 
- This means the endpoint might not be properly registered

## What I just did:
- Restarted the backend server completely (auto-reload may have failed)

## Please try now:
1. Refresh your browser page (F5)
2. Try to create an asset again
3. **If it still fails**, open browser console (F12) and screenshot the error for me
